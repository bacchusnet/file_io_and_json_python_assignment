# file_io_and_json_python_assignment

The "State Manager" (File I/O & JSON)
The Assignment: Create a command-line "Task Manager."

The Goal: Build a script that lets you add tasks via the terminal (python tasks.py add "Buy milk") and saves them to a tasks.json file.

Why it matters: Senior engineers rarely keep data in memory. You must master serialization (converting Python dicts to JSON) and deserialization (loading them back) so your "Scraper" can resume after a crash.

Mastery Check: Can your script handle a corrupted JSON file without crashing? (Hint: Use try/except).
